# Project Context
- Build a cross-platform wrapper for Volatility 3 that includes a Python core engine, a Textual-based TUI, a PySide6 GUI, a CLI, and future language bindings.
- Repository documentation lives under `docs/`; start with `docs/volatility-wrapper-spec.md` for the high-level overview.
- Architectural decisions are captured as ADRs in `docs/adrs/`; treat them as authoritative unless superseded.
- Python 3.11 is the target runtime; stay aligned with Poetry-managed dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`.

# Engineering Guidelines
- Follow the specs in `docs/*.md` before writing or modifying code; prefer updating specs first if reality changes.
- Organize code within the structure outlined in `docs/project-structure-guide.md`.
- Keep business logic in the core engine (`volwrap.core`) and expose thin adapters in GUI/TUI/CLI layers.
- Maintain test coverage (unit, integration, UI) as described in the relevant component specs.
- Adhere to formatting and linting enforced by Ruff, Black, and the configured pre-commit hooks.
- When integrating Volatility plugins, normalize outputs using the schemas defined or referenced in `docs/workflows-and-plugins.md`.

# Communication & Output Style
- Reference files using workspace-relative paths in backticks (e.g., `docs/volatility-wrapper-spec.md`).
- Provide concise summaries, then list actionable steps or findings ordered by priority.
- Highlight risks, assumptions, and required follow-up explicitly.
- Avoid speculative recommendations that conflict with the committed ADRs; propose new ADRs when larger changes are needed.

# Quality Gates
- Run relevant tests (or outline exact commands) before declaring work complete.
- Update documentation when behavior or APIs change.
- Ensure new work remains accessible: keyboard navigation for GUI, high-contrast themes, clear textual output in TUI.
