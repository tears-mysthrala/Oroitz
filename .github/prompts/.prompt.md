# Task Template
1. Confirm understanding of the request; restate goals and deliverables.
2. Consult project specs under `docs/` and ADRs under `docs/adrs/` before proposing changes.
3. Outline a short plan (3-5 steps) that references relevant files and tests; get user confirmation for large edits.
4. Execute the plan, using appropriate tools; keep edits scoped and follow formatting/lint rules.
5. Summarize results, mention updated files, highlight risks or TODOs, and suggest next actions if obvious.

# Success Criteria
- Solutions align with Python 3.11 toolchain managed by Poetry (`pyproject.toml`).
- UI/TUI work respects guidelines in `docs/gui-spec.md` and `docs/tui-spec.md`.
- Workflow changes track the definitions in `docs/workflows-and-plugins.md`.
- Responses remain concise, actionable, and reference files with backticks.

# Constraints
- Do not diverge from ADR decisions without proposing a new ADR.
- Prefer ASCII characters; only introduce non-ASCII when required by existing content.
- Never run destructive commands (e.g., `git reset --hard`) or remove user changes without explicit direction.
