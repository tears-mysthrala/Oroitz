# Volatility Wrapper Specification

## 1. Product Overview

- **Purpose:** Deliver a cross-platform GUI and TUI experience backed by a developer-friendly façade over Volatility 3, streamlining memory forensic workflows, automation integration, and multi-language consumption.
- **Primary Outcome:** Reduce lines of code and the expertise required to run common Volatility investigations while enabling analysts to execute guided workflows visually or from an interactive terminal.
- **Status:** Planning; no implementation work has started.

## 2. Stakeholders & Target Users

- **Incident Responders:** Need quick triage of large memory captures without deep familiarity with Volatility internals.
- **Threat Hunters:** Require programmable access for recurring hunts and hypothesis testing.
- **Tool Integrators:** Want embeddable components to add memory forensics into larger platforms (SIEM, SOAR, DFIR dashboards).
- **Educators & Researchers:** Need reproducible labs and enriched metadata for teaching and experimentation.

## 3. Scope Statement

- **In-Scope:** Unified API surface, CLI companion, cross-platform GUI and TUI applications, plugin orchestration, structured output normalization, result caching, packaging for multiple languages, test harness, documentation, performance benchmarking, governance processes.
- **Out-of-Scope (initial release):** Custom Volatility plugin development, cloud-hosted service layer, managed analytics portal, commercial support portal.

## 4. Success Metrics

- Achieve <10 lines of code for executing top five Volatility workflows (vs. current baseline of 30+).
- Support Windows, Linux, macOS memory images with >90% plugin coverage parity out-of-the-box.
- Deliver JSON and Parquet outputs consumable by downstream analytics tools.
- Reach 80% unit/integration test coverage on wrapper logic.
- Produce quick-start guide enabling new users to complete first investigation within 30 minutes.
- Enable GUI users to execute quick triage workflow end-to-end with fewer than five clicks and TUI users within three guided commands.
- Achieve ≥70 System Usability Scale (SUS) score from pilot analysts for both GUI and TUI experiences.

## 5. Functional Requirements

- **Simplified Command Abstractions:** High-level operations (process listing, network connections, DLL inventory, malfind, timeline) exposed as single calls.
- **Plugin Management:** Discover, enable/disable, parameterize Volatility plugins programmatically; validate compatibility.
- **Output Normalization:** Convert plugin results into schema-validated structures (JSON, CSV, Parquet).
- **Pipeline Integration:** Provide async/batch processing hooks, streaming outputs, and return codes suitable for automation.
- **Session Management:** Persist configuration (paths, workflows) for reuse across runs.
- **Language Bindings:** First-class SDKs for Python and Node.js; publish a CLI that reuses the same core engine.
- **Extensibility Hooks:** Allow custom post-processors, output sinks, and plugin wrappers via documented interfaces.
- **Graphical User Interface:** Offer cross-platform desktop application with workflow templates, visual diffs, search, and export actions; surface remediation hints and contextual documentation.
- **Terminal User Interface:** Provide keyboard-driven interface with rich-text dashboards, progressive disclosure of data, bookmarking, and scriptable command replay.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Process 4 GB memory dump in under 8 minutes on reference hardware (to be defined) using default workflows.
- **Resource Usage:** Configurable concurrency and memory ceilings to operate on constrained DFIR endpoints.
- **Reliability:** Automatic retry of recoverable plugin failures; exhaustive error reporting with remediation hints.
- **Security:** Enforce sandboxed execution where possible, validate external symbol files, and log provenance for evidence handling.
- **Compliance:** Support chain-of-custody requirements, user consent logging, and configurable data retention policies.
- **Maintainability:** Modular architecture, semantic versioning, autogenerated API docs.
- **Usability:** Adhere to established UX heuristics, include accessibility features (keyboard navigation, high-contrast mode), and provide contextual help within GUI/TUI.
- **Responsiveness:** GUI screens must render within 2 seconds for primary workflows; TUI updates should stream without perceptible lag on 100 ms refresh cycles.

## 7. Assumptions & Constraints

- Volatility 3 remains the upstream forensic engine; wrapper does not fork or modify core Volatility behavior.
- Repository targets Python 3.11+ and Node.js 20+ for initial bindings.
- Windows, Linux, and macOS users require comparable experience; differences documented.
- Memory images may be large (hundreds of GB); design must support chunked and resumable processing.

## 8. Technology Evaluation

### 8.1 Language Options

- **Rust Core + Bindings:** Pros: performance, safety, cross-platform static binaries. Cons: higher barrier for contributors, requires FFI layer for Python/Node.
- **Python Native:** Pros: closest to Volatility 3 (Python-based), quickest integration, lowest ramp-up. Cons: slower, packaging complexities for compiled deps.
- **Hybrid (Python Core + Rust Accelerators):** Pros: leverage Python ecosystem while optimizing hot paths. Cons: added build complexity.
- **Recommendation:** Start with Python core for parity and velocity; encapsulate performance-sensitive sections for future Rust reimplementation.

### 8.2 Packaging & Distribution

- Python package (PyPI), Node package (npm) built via native shims, standalone CLI via PyInstaller or Nuitka, optional Docker image for reproducibility.
- Version management via semantic releases, changelog automation, SBOM generation (CycloneDX).

### 8.3 Interface Tooling Options

- **GUI (Qt for Python/PySide6):** Mature cross-platform desktop framework, rich widget set, strong community, permissive licensing; integrates with Python core and supports designer tooling.
- **TUI (Textual/Rich):** Modern Python framework providing reactive layouts, mouse support, and rich formatting inside the terminal; fast iteration and consistent cross-platform behavior.
- **Alternative Considerations:** Electron (heavy runtime requirement), Tauri (Rust-centric build pipeline), Kivy (mobile support but limited desktop look-and-feel), Dear PyGui (GPU-accelerated but less traditional UX).
- **Recommendation:** Adopt PySide6 for the GUI to stay within the Python ecosystem while enabling native-feeling apps, and Textual for the TUI to leverage the same business logic with minimal duplication.

## 9. System Architecture

- **Core Engine:** Orchestrates Volatility invocation, plugin selection, session management, and output serialization.
- **Adapter Layer:** Abstracts Volatility plugin execution, provides caching, and normalizes outputs.
- **Binding Layer:** Exposes language-specific SDKs using shared interface definitions.
- **CLI Layer:** Thin wrapper over core engine with commands mirroring SDK operations.
- **User Interface Layer:** Shares view-models across PySide6 GUI and Textual TUI, offering workflow templates, visualization widgets, and interactive controls.
- **Persistence Layer:** Stores session profiles, cached results, and configuration using pluggable backends (filesystem, SQLite, cloud bucket).
- **Extension Points:** Hooks for post-processing (e.g., YARA scanning), export connectors (S3, Elasticsearch), and custom metrics collectors.

## 10. Data & Schema Strategy

- Define canonical schemas per workflow (processes, DLLs, network endpoints, timeline events) using JSON Schema.
- Provide schema registry and validation utilities.
- Support metadata tagging (source file, analysis timestamp, plugin version, host profile).
- Document conversion requirements for CSV and Parquet outputs.

## 18. Risks & Mitigations

- **Upstream Volatility Changes:** Track upstream releases, automate compatibility tests.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Profile early, identify candidates for Rust or C extensions.
- **Complex Packaging:** Invest in CI pipelines for multi-platform builds, use reproducible containers.
- **Limited Community Adoption:** Engage with Volatility community, provide reference integrations, solicit feedback.
- **Large Memory Footprint:** Implement streaming, chunked processing, and partial result exports.
- **Fragmented UI Tooling:** Maintain shared design system, automate packaging for PySide6/Textual, and provide installer smoke tests per platform.

## 19. Open Questions

- Which memory images will serve as canonical performance benchmarks?
- What governance model (steering committee vs. maintainer core) best suits the project?
- Should telemetry be enabled by default or require affirmative opt-in?
- How much effort to invest in GUI exploration before v1.0?
- Is commercial support within scope or delegated to partners?
- What accessibility standards (WCAG level, Section 508) must the GUI/TUI satisfy at launch?

## 20. Next Steps

1. Validate requirements with target users and Volatility maintainers.
2. Finalize language decision via spike comparing Python-only vs. hybrid approach.
3. Prototype Textual TUI workflow shell and PySide6 wireframes to validate UX direction.
4. Draft high-level project plan with milestones, staffing, and budget.
5. Begin collecting sample memory images and defining performance baselines.
6. Prepare initial ADRs (language selection, interface tooling, packaging, telemetry policy).
