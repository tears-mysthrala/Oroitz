# Oroitz

Oroitz is a cross-platform wrapper around Volatility 3 that delivers a shared Python core, a Textual-powered TUI, a PySide6 desktop GUI, and a CLI so analysts can run guided memory forensics workflows with minimal setup.

## Overview

Oroitz delivers a complete, production-ready memory forensics platform built on Volatility 3:

- **Unified API**: Streamlines common Volatility investigations through a consistent, high-level interface
- **Multi-Interface**: Choose between CLI, GUI, or TUI based on your workflow preferences
- **Real Execution**: Direct integration with Volatility 3 CLI for authentic memory analysis
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatic symbol table detection eliminates manual profile configuration
- **Structured Output**: Normalized plugin outputs in JSON/CSV formats for downstream analysis
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture supports custom workflows and output processors

## Features

## Project Status

Oroitz is a fully functional cross-platform Volatility 3 wrapper with complete CLI, GUI, and TUI interfaces. The system uses real Volatility 3 execution with automatic symbol table detection, comprehensive testing, and production-ready documentation. All core workflows are operational with proper output normalization and export capabilities.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python 3.11 and ensure `python --version` reports 3.11.x.
2. Install Poetry per the instructions at <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>.
3. From the repository root, run `poetry install` to create the virtual environment and pull dependencies.
4. Activate the Poetry shell with `poetry shell`, or prefix commands with `poetry run`.
5. Run the quality checks: `poetry run pytest` for tests and `poetry run ruff check .` for linting.

Volatility 3 is listed as a dependency in `pyproject.toml`; no additional manual installation is required for local development. Real memory samples are included in the `samples/` directory for testing the Volatility integration. The system automatically detects symbol tables from memory images - no manual profile configuration needed.

### Running Oroitz

Once installed, you can run Oroitz in several ways:

- **CLI**: `poetry run python -m oroitz.cli --help` to see available commands
- **GUI**: `poetry run python -m oroitz.ui.gui` to launch the PySide6 desktop application
- **TUI**: `poetry run python -m oroitz.ui.tui` to launch the Textual terminal interface

Example CLI usage:

```bash
# Run quick triage analysis (Volatility 3 auto-detects symbol tables)
poetry run python -m oroitz.cli quick-triage /path/to/memory/image.mem --output results.json

# Test with real memory sample (Windows Server 2008 SP1 x86)
poetry run python -m oroitz.cli quick-triage samples/memdump.mem --output real-results.json
```

## Repository Layout
