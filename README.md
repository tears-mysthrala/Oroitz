# Oroitz

Oroitz is a cross-platform wrapper around Volatility 3 that delivers a shared Python core, a Textual-powered TUI, a PySide6 desktop GUI, and a CLI so analysts can run guided memory forensics workflows with minimal setup.

## Overview

- Streamlines common Volatility investigations through a unified, high-level API surface.
- Normalizes plugin outputs into structured formats that downstream tools can consume.
- Shares workflow logic across CLI, GUI, and TUI adapters for consistent analyst experiences.
- Prioritizes extensibility so teams can add custom workflows, post-processors, and output targets.

## Features

### Core Engine

- Workflow orchestration with plugin execution and result aggregation
- Output normalization and export (JSON, CSV support planned)
- Session management for configuration persistence
- Telemetry and logging infrastructure

### Workflows

- **Quick Triage**: Processes, network connections, and memory analysis
- Extensible workflow registry for custom analysis pipelines

### Interfaces

- **CLI**: Command-line interface with `quick-triage`, `tui`, and `gui` commands
- **GUI**: PySide6-based desktop application with session wizard, dashboard, and results explorer
- **TUI**: Textual-powered terminal interface with interactive workflow selection

### Testing

- Comprehensive unit tests for core components
- UI testing framework setup (GUI tests currently have Qt compatibility issues)
- Mock data fallback for development without real memory images

## Project Status

The repository has progressed from planning to active development with a functional core engine, CLI, GUI, and TUI implementations. The system currently uses mock data for Volatility 3 plugin execution while Volatility integration is being finalized. Core workflows, output normalization, and user interfaces are operational. Refer to [`docs/development-plan.md`](docs/development-plan.md) for the current roadmap and milestones.

- âœ… ResultsScreen with DataTable exports for `quick_triage` outputs
- âœ… Command palette, shortcuts, and error handling overlays
- âœ… Automated tests (Textual pilot) - basic tests working, expanding coverage
- âœ… Manual testing feedback collection

#### Phase 4 â€“ GUI (Beta)

- âœ… Scaffold PySide6 application with MainWindow and Landing View
- âœ… Implement New Session Wizard and integrate with core session creation
- âœ… Build Session Dashboard showing workflow progress and logs
- âœ… Implement Results Explorer with table filtering and export actions
- âœ… Add Settings dialog, notification center, and theming support
- âœ… Write pytest-qt integration tests covering wizard and dashboard flows
- âœ… Gather usability feedback and iterate on layout
- âœ… Add file dialog for opening existing sessions
- âœ… Implement About dialog in menu bar
- âœ… Add proper file dialogs for export paths (currently uses home directory)

### ðŸš§ **Current Focus**

#### Testing Infrastructure & UI Polish

- âœ… Complete comprehensive test coverage for GUI and TUI interfaces
- âœ… Resolve PySide6/Textual import conflicts with isolated test environments
- âœ… Polish UI/UX based on testing feedback
- âœ… **Add real memory samples for integration testing** (Windows Server 2008 SP1 x86 from Samsclass.info)

### ðŸ“‹ **Upcoming Phases**

#### Phase 5 â€“ Feature Expansion

- Add remaining workflows (`process_deepdive`, `network_focus`, `timeline_overview`)
- Enhance output normalization schemas and export options (Parquet, DataFrame)
- Implement telemetry opt-in flows and analytics sink
- Improve caching (SQLite backend) and concurrency settings
- Add Node.js binding stub (if required)

#### Phase 6 â€“ Hardening & Release Prep

- Performance benchmarking with large memory images
- Complete documentation site with guides and screenshots
- Finalize installer packaging (PyInstaller) and distribution artifacts
- Prepare release checklist and CI/CD workflows
- Security review and community feedback collection

### ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Complete UI Testing**: Finish TUI test expansion and comprehensive validation
2. **Real Volatility Integration**: Replace mock data with actual Volatility 3 execution
3. **Performance Optimization**: Benchmark and optimize for large memory images
4. **Documentation**: Create user guides and API documentation
5. **CI/CD Setup**: Implement automated testing and release pipelines

### ðŸ“Š **Progress Metrics**

## Getting Started

1. Install Python 3.11 and ensure `python --version` reports 3.11.x.
2. Install Poetry per the instructions at <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>.
3. From the repository root, run `poetry install` to create the virtual environment and pull dependencies.
4. Activate the Poetry shell with `poetry shell`, or prefix commands with `poetry run`.
5. Run the quality checks: `poetry run pytest` for tests and `poetry run ruff check .` for linting.

Volatility 3 is listed as a dependency in `pyproject.toml`; no additional manual installation is required for local development. Real memory samples are included in the `samples/` directory for testing the Volatility integration.

### Running Oroitz

Once installed, you can run Oroitz in several ways:

- **CLI**: `poetry run python -m oroitz.cli --help` to see available commands
- **GUI**: `poetry run python -m oroitz.ui.gui` to launch the PySide6 desktop application
- **TUI**: `poetry run python -m oroitz.ui.tui` to launch the Textual terminal interface

Example CLI usage:

```bash
# Run quick triage analysis (currently uses mock data)
poetry run python -m oroitz.cli quick-triage /path/to/memory/image.mem --profile Win10x64_19041 --output results.json

# Test with real memory sample (Windows Server 2008 SP1 x86)
poetry run python -m oroitz.cli quick-triage samples/memdump.mem --profile Win2008SP1x86 --output real-results.json
```
