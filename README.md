# Oroitz

Oroitz is a cross-platform wrapper around Volatility 3 that delivers a shared Python core, a Textual-powered TUI, a PySide6 desktop GUI, and a CLI so analysts can run guided memory forensics workflows with minimal setup.

## Overview

- Streamlines common Volatility investigations through a unified, high-level API surface.
- Normalizes plugin outputs into structured formats that downstream tools can consume.
- Shares workflow logic across CLI, GUI, and TUI adapters for consistent analyst experiences.
- Prioritizes extensibility so teams can add custom workflows, post-processors, and output targets.

## Features

### Core Engine

- Workflow orchestration with plugin execution and result aggregation
- Output normalization and export (JSON, CSV support planned)
- Session management for configuration persistence
- Telemetry and logging infrastructure

### Workflows

- **Quick Triage**: Processes, network connections, and memory analysis
- Extensible workflow registry for custom analysis pipelines

### Interfaces

- **CLI**: Command-line interface with `quick-triage`, `tui`, and `gui` commands
- **GUI**: PySide6-based desktop application with session wizard, dashboard, and results explorer
- **TUI**: Textual-powered terminal interface with interactive workflow selection

### Testing

- Comprehensive unit tests for core components
- UI testing framework setup (GUI tests currently have Qt compatibility issues)
- Mock data fallback for development without real memory images

## Project Status

The repository has progressed from planning to active development with a functional core engine, CLI, GUI, and TUI implementations. The system currently uses mock data for Volatility 3 plugin execution while Volatility integration is being finalized. Core workflows, output normalization, and user interfaces are operational. Refer to [`docs/development-plan.md`](docs/development-plan.md) for the current roadmap and milestones.

## Development Roadmap

- ✅ Git repository initialized with pre-commit hooks

#### Phase 1 – Core Foundation

- ✅ Repository structure scaffolded
- ✅ Configuration system implemented (`oroitz.core.config`)
- ✅ Logging/telemetry infrastructure added
- ✅ Session model and persistence layer created
- ✅ Unit tests for configuration and session persistence

#### Phase 2 – Workflow & Volatility Integration

- ✅ Workflow registry implemented and seeded with workflows
- ✅ Volatility 3 execution integration via `oroitz.core.executor` (currently using mock data)
- ✅ Output normalization and schema validation for `quick_triage` data
- ✅ Caching layer for plugin results
- ✅ CLI prototype commands for `quick_triage` testing
- ✅ Unit/integration tests for `quick_triage` end-to-end (comprehensive coverage including schema validation, caching, and CLI)

#### Phase 3 – TUI (Baseline) (In Progress)

- ✅ Textual application structure scaffolded
- ✅ HomeScreen, SessionWizardScreen, and RunScreen implemented
- ✅ ResultsScreen with DataTable exports for `quick_triage` outputs
- ✅ Command palette, shortcuts, and error handling overlays
- 🔄 Automated tests (Textual pilot) - basic tests working, expanding coverage
- 🔄 Manual testing feedback collection

#### Phase 4 – GUI (Beta) (In Progress)

- ✅ PySide6 application scaffolded with MainWindow and LandingView
- ✅ New Session Wizard implemented and integrated
- ✅ Session Dashboard with workflow progress and logs
- ✅ Results Explorer with table filtering and export actions
- ✅ Settings dialog, notification center, and theming support
- 🔄 pytest-qt integration tests - 17/17 tests passing, expanding coverage
- 🔄 Usability feedback collection

### 🚧 **Current Focus**

#### Testing Infrastructure & UI Polish

- Complete comprehensive test coverage for GUI and TUI interfaces
- Resolve PySide6/Textual import conflicts with isolated test environments
- Polish UI/UX based on testing feedback
- Prepare for real Volatility 3 integration

### 📋 **Upcoming Phases**

#### Phase 5 – Feature Expansion

- Add remaining workflows (`process_deepdive`, `network_focus`, `timeline_overview`)
- Enhance output normalization schemas and export options (Parquet, DataFrame)
- Implement telemetry opt-in flows and analytics sink
- Improve caching (SQLite backend) and concurrency settings
- Add Node.js binding stub (if required)

#### Phase 6 – Hardening & Release Prep

- Performance benchmarking with large memory images
- Complete documentation site with guides and screenshots
- Finalize installer packaging (PyInstaller) and distribution artifacts
- Prepare release checklist and CI/CD workflows
- Security review and community feedback collection

### 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Complete UI Testing**: Finish TUI test expansion and comprehensive validation
2. **Real Volatility Integration**: Replace mock data with actual Volatility 3 execution
3. **Performance Optimization**: Benchmark and optimize for large memory images
4. **Documentation**: Create user guides and API documentation
5. **CI/CD Setup**: Implement automated testing and release pipelines

### 📊 **Progress Metrics**

- **Core Engine**: 100% ✅ (Configuration, sessions, workflows, caching, CLI)
- **GUI Implementation**: 95% ✅ (17/17 tests passing, all major features implemented)
- **TUI Implementation**: 90% ✅ (Basic functionality working, tests in progress)
- **Testing Infrastructure**: 85% ✅ (Comprehensive test suite, isolated environments)
- **Volatility Integration**: 70% 🔄 (Mock data working, real integration pending)
- **Documentation**: 60% 🔄 (Specs complete, user guides needed)

## Getting Started

1. Install Python 3.11 and ensure `python --version` reports 3.11.x.
2. Install Poetry per the instructions at <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>.
3. From the repository root, run `poetry install` to create the virtual environment and pull dependencies.
4. Activate the Poetry shell with `poetry shell`, or prefix commands with `poetry run`.
5. Run the quality checks: `poetry run pytest` for tests and `poetry run ruff check .` for linting.

Volatility 3 is listed as a dependency in `pyproject.toml`; no additional manual installation is required for local development.

### Running Oroitz

Once installed, you can run Oroitz in several ways:

- **CLI**: `poetry run python -m oroitz.cli --help` to see available commands
- **GUI**: `poetry run python -m oroitz.ui.gui` to launch the PySide6 desktop application
- **TUI**: `poetry run python -m oroitz.ui.tui` to launch the Textual terminal interface

Example CLI usage:

```bash
# Run quick triage analysis (currently uses mock data)
poetry run python -m oroitz.cli quick-triage /path/to/memory/image.mem --profile Win10x64_19041 --output results.json
```

## Repository Layout

- `oroitz/core/`: Python engine that orchestrates Volatility 3 workflows, output normalization, and session management (currently using mock data)
