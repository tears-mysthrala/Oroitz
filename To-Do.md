# Volatility wrapper

I wanna make a wrapper for Volatility 3 that makes it easier to use and integrate into other tools. We need to decide if we wanna make it in rust, python, or something else. We also need to figure out what features we want to include and how we want to structure the project.

## Goals

- Simplify the usage of Volatility 3 for common tasks
- Provide a clean and easy-to-use API

## Requirements

- Simplified API for common tasks
- Integration with popular programming languages
- Documentation and examples

## Implementation Plan

1. Define the core functionality to expose
2. Create language bindings (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
3. Write comprehensive tests
4. Document the API and provide usage examples
5. Release and gather feedback for improvements
6. Iterate based on user feedback and add new features as needed
7. Ensure compatibility with future versions of Volatility 3
8. Explore integration with other forensic tools and platforms
9. Optimize performance for large memory dumps
10. Create a community forum for users to share tips and ask questions
11. Regularly update the wrapper to fix bugs and add enhancements
12. Consider adding a GUI for users who prefer not to use command-line interfaces
13. Collaborate with the Volatility community to ensure alignment with their goals and updates
14. Explore potential for commercial support or premium features
15. Monitor usage and gather analytics to understand how users interact with the wrapper
16. Plan for long-term maintenance and support
17. Ensure compliance with relevant legal and ethical standards in digital forensics
18. Seek partnerships with educational institutions for training and workshops
